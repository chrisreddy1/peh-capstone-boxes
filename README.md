# üéì Practical Ethical Hacking (PEH) Mid‚ÄëCourse Capstone Write‚ÄëUps

This repository contains walkthroughs for several **capstone challenge boxes** from the *Practical Ethical Hacking* course by **TCM Security Academy**. These machines test and reinforce key ethical hacking skills including enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques.

## üìö About the Course

The [Practical Ethical Hacking](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) course by TCM Security provides hands-on, lab-based learning for aspiring ethical hackers. The **Mid-Course Capstone** section includes vulnerable machines to assess your understanding of:

- Scanning & enumeration
- Exploiting misconfigurations
- Web and network vulnerabilities
- Local and privilege escalation techniques

## üóÇ Write‚ÄëUps

| Box Name  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Academy](./Academy.md) | Debian-based machine focusing on enumeration and privilege escalation. |
| [Blackpearl](./Blackpearl.md) | Web-focused Linux box involving DNS enumeration, virtual hosts, and privilege escalation. |
| [Blue](./Blue.md) | Windows 7 box vulnerable to EternalBlue (MS17-010). Classic SMB exploitation. |
| [Dev](./Dev.md) | Linux box involving NFS exploitation, archive brute-forcing, LFI, and escalation via GTFObins. |
| [Jenkins](./Jenkins.md) | Exploitation of Jenkins CI/CD misconfigurations and privilege escalation (if applicable). |

Each `.md` file includes:

- Recon & enumeration steps
- Exploitation paths and tools used
- Privilege escalation methodology
- Final flag retrieval
- Key lessons and takeaways

## üõ† Usage

1. Clone this repository  
2. Read through each write-up  
3. Try to replicate each box in a lab setting  
4. Use the notes to reinforce your understanding or prep for certs like PJPT / PNPT

## ‚úÖ Tips for Learners

- Take your time with **recon and enumeration** ‚Äì it's often the most important step.
- Keep notes as you go ‚Äì documenting your process helps in real engagements.
- Look into **post-exploitation** steps and what real attackers might do after initial access.
- Use these write-ups as learning tools, not just as copy-paste solutions.
